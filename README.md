## Key Features

- Upload a smartphone back cover image to detect its brand using object recognition.
- Select filtering criteria such as RAM, internal memory, screen size, camera quality, and price.
- Get the top 5 recommended phones using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA).
- Fully containerized architecture with minimal dependencies.

## Docker Notes

Ensure the following dependencies are present in `backend/Dockerfile` for OpenCV:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
```
