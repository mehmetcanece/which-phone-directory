## ðŸ§  Features

- Upload a smartphone back cover image to **brand recognition** using object recognition.
- Choose filtering criteria such as **RAM**, **internal memory**, **screen size**, **camera quality**, and **price**.
- See the top 5 phones calculated using **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)**.
- Fully containerized setup with minimal system dependencies.

## ðŸ“¦ Docker Notes

Your `backend/Dockerfile` must include the following to support OpenCV:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
```

These packages are required for OpenCVâ€™s `cv2` module to run correctly.
