In this study, missing values in the battery_capacity column (encoded as 0) were imputed using a context-aware approach. Rather than replacing all missing entries with a global median value, a group-wise imputation strategy was adopted. Specifically, devices were grouped based on similar hardware specifications — namely ram_capacity, internal_memory, and screen_size — and the median battery capacity within each group was used to impute the missing values. This method allowed for more realistic estimations by leveraging feature similarity among devices. In rare cases where a matching group could not be identified, the overall median value was used as a fallback. This approach preserved data variability and provided a more robust foundation for subsequent modeling efforts.
